## About me:

I am a 3rd year student at Cherkasy National University, majoring in Software Engineering. I've been studying programming for 3 years. Mostly I am engaged in C# programming using OOP paradigms with console or winform representation. Now I intend to learn a new programming language for myself - JS.

## Skills:

* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* GIT
* JS

## Code Example:

KATA from Codewars: *Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for [some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaden). When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. Task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith.*

```javascript
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  let array = this.split(' ');
  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    result += array[i][0].toUpperCase() + array[i].substring(1, array[i].length)+ " ";
  }
  return result.trim();
};
```
